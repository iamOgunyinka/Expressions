Write an algorithm, which linearizes all plus nodes in an expression. A linearized plus node is a node where the left child is not a plus node.

Algorithm
=========

1) Mark the top node of the graph/tree as the root node.
2) For each left child of that node, if it is a '+' node, then adapt that child's right child as your own right child.
3) Next assign that child's right node to be its left( by simplying shifting it over ),
4) Assign that child's right child to be the root's right child and assign the root's right child to be that child( the original '+' ).
5) Once you run out of right children that are '+' then move down to your own right child and repeat step 2 through 5 for every child of the selected node.
